# language_of_taste
This is the repository that contains all code and data for my PhD, The Language of Taste. There are notebooks for three chapters: 
2_Method_Theory.ipynb corresponds with chapter 2, 3_Sources corresponds with chapter 3 and holds the code used for buidling the corpora 
and 4 corresponds with the chapter with results and holds the code written to query the data and obtain the quantitative results. 
The directory corpora holds the source texts, divided in two folders: C6070 holds all texts from the 1960s and 1970s, C8090 holds all texts 
from the 1980s and 1990s.
